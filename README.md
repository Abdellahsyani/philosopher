# Philosophers

## üìñ Project Overview

- The Philosophers project is part of the 42 curriculum designed to introduce students to multithreading and process synchronization in C. It is a simulation of the classic "Dining Philosophers Problem," where philosophers alternate between eating, sleeping, and thinking while sharing limited resources (forks).

- The challenge lies in correctly managing concurrent access to forks and ensuring that no philosopher starves or causes a deadlock.

## üìù Mandatory Objectives

- 1. Program Name

- ./philo

- 2. Arguments:

- number_of_philosophers time_to_die time_to_eat time_to_sleep [number_of_times_each_philosopher_must_eat]

- number_of_philosophers: The number of philosophers and forks (must be > 0).

- time_to_die: Time (in milliseconds) a philosopher can go without eating before dying.

- time_to_eat: Time (in milliseconds) it takes for a philosopher to eat.

- time_to_sleep: Time (in milliseconds) a philosopher spends sleeping.

- [number_of_times_each_philosopher_must_eat]: Optional. If specified, simulation stops when all philosophers have eaten this many times.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Program Rules

- Each philosopher must think ‚Üí take forks ‚Üí eat ‚Üí release forks ‚Üí sleep in a continuous loop.

- Philosophers must not die (starve) if resources are available.

- The simulation ends if:

- A philosopher dies.

- All philosophers have eaten the required number of times (if specified).

- Output must be timestamped and include philosopher ID and current action:
```
800 1 is eating
2000 3 died
```

## üîë Key Concepts to Implement

- Threads:

- Each philosopher runs in its own thread.

- Mutexes:

- Use mutexes to protect shared resources (forks).

- Timers:

- Use gettimeofday or equivalent to manage precise timing.

- Synchronization:

- Ensure philosophers never:

- Eat without both forks.

- Cause deadlocks by improper fork grabbing order.

- Death Detection:

- A monitor thread or function must check regularly if any philosopher exceeds time_to_die.
